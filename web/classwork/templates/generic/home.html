    <h2>What People Say About Our Classes!</h2>
    <p>
      "Thank you for the wonderful experience! The way you taught dancing made it easy to learn, and your clear explanations, high energy and humor made the class one of the best I have ever had. I would recommend your classes to anyone who wants to learn ... while having loads of fun!" -- former student.
    </p>
    <p>
      "... would definitely be my first choice. I *wish* I had learned the basics from them - I would have had WAY less bad habits to get over â€¦ Good beginning instruction in the basics is one of the most vital factors in starting off ... " -- from online discussion of Seattle Swing Dance instruction.
