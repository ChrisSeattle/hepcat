      Sometimes the payment can take some time before it is confirmed.

    <p> You should get an email confirmation for the your class registration.
      During the class we typically send weekly class emails with additional
      resources, such as review videos and other useful class information.
      If any unforeseen issues come up, such as moving or postponing the class
      due to weather or other issues, we will inform all of the students by email.
      If you do not get the initial confirmation email, please make
      sure it is not blocked by your spam filters. If the email you provided is
      not the best to reach you, please update your
      <a href="{% url 'profile_page' %}">contact information here.</a></li>
